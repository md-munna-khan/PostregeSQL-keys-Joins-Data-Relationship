This module dives into the fundamentals of relational database connections using foreign keys and constraints. You’ll learn how to work with different types of SQL joins—Inner, Left, Right, Full, Cross, and Natural—to combine data effectively across tables. To strengthen your skills, we’ve included hands-on SQL practice sessions so you can apply what you’ve learned in real scenarios.
